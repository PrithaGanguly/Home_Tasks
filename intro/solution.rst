This is Pritha Ganguly,a 5th semester Btech student of Computer Science and Engineering department of National Institute of Technology,Durgapur.

This is the first time I am attending this summer training.My roommate told me about it.I am enjoying being a part of this training.Though the mentors here are a bit strict about following the guidelines(which is good), they are eager to help the newbies like me(of course if they are eager to help themselves).At present we just begun with python training.
